### What is this repository about

#### Book-Bazar is a project in which I have recreated an existing website with as accurately similar styling as possible. The main idea of the project was to copy the looks of the website without looking into the source code. After that I wanted to compare my own version with the original created by the authors for educational purposes. I chose this website specifically to be able to use a variety of new tools and external libraries in order to expand my knowledge and expertise as a React Developer. The link to the original website:

### Acknowledgments

#### Book Bazar Project is my second repository in which I have recreated an existing website for training purposes. I wanted to advance my skills as a React Developer and create a more complex project in comparison to the first repository. I have designed a website which resembles an online book shop where the user can view books, add them to the cart and purchase the item.
